# Simulation Code for Single-Cell mtDNA Lineage Tracing

 This repository is dedicated to providing researchers with the tools and code necessary to replicate and explore the computational simulations presented in our paper.

## Repository Contents
- `mtDNAsim/`: This directory acts as a Python package and includes all the modules and functions required for running the simulations and subsequent analysis.
- `scripts/`: Contains standalone Python scripts that can be executed from the command line or submitted to a Slurm workload manager for batch processing.

## Getting Started
To get started with the simulations:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Follow the scripts in './scripts' to run the simulations.
